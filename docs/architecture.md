# Architecture tour

A newcomer-altitude walk through the system. Depth on any topic: the
design doc (`Project_AISLE_Experiment_Design.md`, §2–§5) and the spec
that owns it (`specs/`).

## External benchmark trust boundary

<!-- claim:architecture/four-zone-boundary -->
The **coding-agent session** is the benchmark experimental unit. AISLE names
four trust zones so “the agent cannot” is never used where the repository only
says “the protocol forbids”:

1. **Mutable participant** — the coding agent, its workspace, declared robot
   graph, participant nodes, and allowed configuration.
2. **Frozen evaluator** — tracked task, scorer, admissibility, and analysis
   artifacts whose hashes are checked at session start and audit time.
3. **Trusted actuation** — the scoped validator and command guard boundary that
   gates declared graph paths and clamps commands; it is not yet a claim about
   arbitrary process, socket, or driver side channels.
4. **Hidden controller** — task selection, randomization, seeds, sealed faults,
   and treatment assignment kept outside the participant-visible workspace.

Sealed task/fault contents and held-out assignments are intended to be
**inaccessible** to the participant. Direct actuation outside declared
participant interfaces is **forbidden** by protocol but is not yet proven
inaccessible. The broader bypass boundary and attack classes are deferred to
issue **#350**; until that threat model is ratified and evaluated, AISLE claims
declared-topology gating only.

## The stack in one picture

```
BRAIN      coding agent (Claude Code / Codex) under a contract
             composes graphs, authors nodes, runs rollouts, logs ideas
ARTIFACTS  git: dataflow YAML, skills/, manifests, evalcards
EVIDENCE   runs/: Arrow traces, videos, results, idea tree
EXECUTION  dora-rs runtime — typed topics, dynamic node add/remove
WORLD      Genesis physics scene (pharmacy desk; retail store)
```

The agent never touches the simulator directly. It edits **artifacts**
(a typed dataflow YAML plus node code), asks the harness to run them,
and reads **evidence** back. Everything in between is enforced
machinery.

## The dataflow layer (dora-rs)

A run is a dora dataflow: nodes connected by typed Arrow topics,
declared in YAML (`graphs/`). The topic contract (SPEC 010,
`src/aisle/topics.py`) fixes schemas, rates, units (radians, base
frame) for every topic class. Two hand-written expert graphs serve as
baselines and integration tests:

- `graphs/expert_t0.yaml` — fixed-pose desk pick (tier T0).
- `graphs/expert_s1.yaml` — mobile retail product-picking (S1).

Every graph passes through the **validator** (SPEC 060) before it runs:
edge-by-edge schema/rate checks, unique ids, every input has a
producer, embodiment consistency — plus the safety-structural checks
below. Errors are machine-actionable JSON with hints; this is the
agent's compile loop.

### Simulated-time lockstep (ADR-30)

Measured graphs do not run on wall time. A `turn-barrier` node opens each
simulated turn, and every node with a forward-edge path to a bridge command
or reset input participates: it declares `AISLE_LOCKSTEP` / `AISLE_TURN_NODE`
/ `AISLE_TURN_OUTPUTS`, and closes turn *k* only after receiving every count
declared by its forward upstreams for *k* and by episodic producers for
*k-1*. Cycles are legal exactly through inputs declared `turn_edge: episodic`
— the request/reply and goal/result loops that TC-6 and TC-7 need.

The barrier loads a **committed turn plan** (`graphs/turn_plans/<stem>.json`)
at runtime, which makes the plan executable scheduler topology rather than
documentation. Two consequences follow, and both are enforced: the plans are
frozen alongside the graphs they compile from, and `harness validate` refuses
a graph whose plan disagrees with it (`TURN_PLAN_STALE`) — a stale plan does
not fail at the gate, it kills the barrier on the first watermark and every
episode wall-clamps. Agents regenerate with
`harness validate <graph> --write-turn-plan`.

The validator's `CLOCK_*` family enforces all of this structurally:
participation completeness, queue policy on watermark edges, forward-DAG
acyclicity, and exactly one terminal commit back to the bridge.

### Fleet mode

Two distinct things share the name, and they are not interchangeable:

- **`src/aisle/harness/fleet.py`** fans one graph out across N environments
  (`fleet_graph` rewrites node ids per agent) — the batched-envs "virtual
  robot fleet" of design-doc §5.
- **`tools/a5_fleet.py`** runs N *independent research-agent sessions*
  concurrently, each with its own simulator on a shared host. This is what
  A5 measured, and the ADR records the deviation from §8.4.3: lanes share the
  host rather than one batched bridge, and peer cross-pollination is deferred.

A5's measured behaviour: throughput saturates near four lanes on a 16-core
host, per-agent latency degrades gracefully, and **holdout quality is
contention-invariant** — contention costs latency, not correctness.

## The frozen set (the no-cheating rule)

The frozen set (CON-7) is hash-manifested by `tools/env_hash.py`, with
changes only via human-merged `env-change` PRs. The rollout runner refuses
to start if hashes drift from the trusted baseline. Agents can read this
code; they cannot change what judges them.

A per-directory map of which frozen paths live where is **generated** at
[`docs/generated/project-inventory.md`](generated/project-inventory.md#repository-layout)
— derived from the constants below, so it cannot disagree with what is
actually attested. (The design doc's §8.0 tree predates all of this and is
marked superseded there.)

**Read `FROZEN_DIRS` / `FROZEN_FILES` / `FROZEN_GLOBS` in
`tools/env_hash.py`, not a list in prose** — a second copy of the fence goes
stale, which is exactly how `src/aisle/mobility` stayed outside it (issue
#189, ADR-33). As orientation only: the scenes, verifier and reset packages,
the mobility verdicts, the budget guard, the topic/turn/kinematics modules,
the SO-101 assets, the budget ledger, and — as the set has widened — the
expert *and* evaluation graphs together with their committed ADR-30 turn
plans.

That widening is worth understanding, because each step followed the same
argument: **the unit of the fence is what a result depends on, not the
directory it lives in.**

- **ADR-33** pulled in the mobility verdicts after PR #177 changed nav's
  stall and timeout budgets without moving a hash — two runs with different
  failure conditions attested as the same environment.
- **#197** pulled in `graphs/turn_plans/expert_*.json`: the turn barrier
  loads the committed plan at runtime, so an unfrozen plan lets the
  scheduler topology of a measured run change silently.
- **ADR-36** pulled in `graphs/eval_*.yaml` and their plans. Those graphs are
  the exam an agent-authored skill sits to enter the registry
  (`harness skill register` scores through them), and they were editable by
  the candidate. A gate the candidate can edit is not a gate.

`graphs/agent_campaign.yaml` deliberately stays **out**: it is the research
agent's own deliverable, which the campaign instructs it to keep current, so
freezing it would put CON-7 in direct conflict with the experiment.

Safety is structural, not behavioral (H5):

- **Oracle isolation** — the bridge publishes a privileged
  `oracle_state` topic (all object poses); the validator refuses any
  graph routing it to anything but the verifier (VAL-6).
- **Motion gating** — every `joint_cmd`/`gripper_cmd` path must pass
  through the `budget-guard` node (SPEC 080), which clamps joint/vel/
  workspace limits and enforces episode timeouts. Only
  `safety_class: motion` nodes may command the arm, and motion nodes
  without an evalcard are refused.
- **Trust anchors** — the budget guard, frozen-set nodes, and `env/`
  code can never be hot-swapped on a live dataflow (`harness swap`
  refuses, HAR-10).

## The world (Genesis)

`src/aisle/scenes/` builds scenes from (seed, embodiment, tier) — a
function, not a script, so reset/batching/randomization are all
reconstructible. The **pharmacy desk** (SPEC 020): shelf, five medicine
boxes, tray, distractors, fixed-base arm. The **retail store**
(SPEC 200): aisles, planogram-governed shelf slots, mobile base +
arm — scenarios S1 (order picking), S2 (restocking), S3 (misplaced-item
return), all verified by diffing live state against
`planogram.toml`.

One bridge node (`dora-genesis`, SPEC 030) owns the simulator and
speaks Arrow on the contract topics. Tiers (T0–T4 desk, S1–S3 retail)
select task difficulty; the perception ladder (L0 oracle poses → L1
ground-truth segmentation → L2 full pixels) selects which pose source a
graph may use.

## Verification and reset (frozen)

The **oracle verifier** (SPEC 040) judges episodes from `oracle_state`:
success plus a failure taxonomy (`wrong_object`, `dropped`, `timeout`,
`never_grasped`, retail adds `misplaced`, `misaligned`, `overhang`).
The asymmetric goal makes `wrong_object` the metric that must stay at
zero. A **realistic verifier** (camera-based, portable to hardware) is
specified (VER-5) with its design brief at
`decisions/ADR-realistic-verifier.md`; fidelity against the oracle is a
first-class result. The realistic verifier is VER-5; the fidelity job
that measures agreement plus false-success/false-fail rates against
the oracle is VER-6. Reset is a service node: `teleport` (state reset)
now, `behavioral` (robot re-shelves the box) later.

## The capability registry

`registry/manifests/*.yaml` — one typed manifest per node: provides/
requires, input/output schemas and rates, params with ranges,
embodiment support, `safety_class`, eval status. The manifests cover
the desk stack, the retail additions (base driver, waypoint nav,
patrol, order reader, stock/misplacement detectors, placement
controller, task planner), the perception rungs, and system nodes —
the exact, current catalog is generated into
[`generated/project-inventory.md`](generated/project-inventory.md)
rather than counted by hand here. The registry is what
makes graph composition an LLM-reliable operation — and its deliberate
gaps are experiment probes (uninstalled hub packages were H1's dominant
failure; see `analysis/h1/`).

Skills are the registry's growth path: an agent-authored node or
subgraph + manifest + evalcard, registered via `harness skill register`
(runs the skill's eval suite first). The design intent is for subgraph
skills to nest as single named nodes with trace attribution preserved;
today registered skills are used as single nodes — subgraph NESTING in
the validator/graphs is deliberately deferred (ADR-22 item 6).

## The harness

`uv run harness {validate,rollout,traces,report,skill,swap,probe}` —
every command JSON-to-stdout (CON-8). `rollout` is the workhorse: it
verifies env hashes, validates the graph, launches per-episode, records
traces, and writes a reproducible run manifest (CON-5: same seed, same
result). `swap`/`probe` mutate or inspect a LIVE dataflow (HAR-10..12)
— the H4 iteration-latency mechanism. Full CLI walkthrough:
`harness-guide.md`.

Research agents run under a separate contract
(`harness/CLAUDE.research.md`) with an idea gate: no rollout without an
open idea-tree entry stating hypothesis and expected effect. That log
is what makes a campaign auditable afterward.
