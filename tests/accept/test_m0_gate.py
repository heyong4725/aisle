"""SPEC 090 acceptance: the M0 gate.

M0-1/M0-2 share one module-scoped 50-episode rollout (the spec's M0-2 is
"re-running M0-1", so the second full run happens inside the M0-2 test).
The run directories are kept under runs/ as evidence for the ADR-M0
sign-off (M0-6). M0-4 is enforced by tools/trace_check.py --strict in CI;
M0-6 is a human act, not a test.
