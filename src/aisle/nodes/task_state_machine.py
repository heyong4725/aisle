"""task-state-machine node (CAP-5): episode sequencing per TC-7.

A goal opens an episode: emit one target_request naming the med, then
>=1 Hz episode_feedback until the verifier's episode_result closes it.
Violations from the guard are counted into the feedback.

In-context retries (HAR-3): when the executor reports a finished grasp
plan (`plan_done`) and no verdict has closed the episode within a grace
window, the attempt FAILED in-flight (box missed, slipped, was refused)
— the machine re-issues target_request, up to `max_retries` times, and
the retry count rides in every episode_feedback so the rollout client
can record honest pass@8 (never best-of-8 independent episodes). The
grace window is tick-based (CON-5): a success verdict lands within a
tick or two of plan completion, and retrying before it could re-grasp
the DELIVERED box out of the tray. max_retries=0 (the default) is
byte-identical to the old one-attempt behavior (ADR-10).

T2 tier (design doc §3, idea I13): the medicine is identified by its
printed label, so the machine runs a SCAN TOUR before the grasp.
Candidates are the detected target pose plus its neighbour rows (all
box positions — at T2 the detector's identity claims are color-derived
noise; only the positions are trusted). Per candidate: `read_move`
parks the wrist camera at the face (ik-trajectory answers `move_done`
with the ladder range actually used), `read_request` asks the label
reader, and a matching `read_result` promotes the candidate to
`grasp_target` — the same schema the grasp planner consumes as
target_pose, so the grasp pipeline is untouched. A refused read or a
non-matching label advances the tour; an exhausted tour idles and the
episode closes honestly on the verifier's timeout.

T4 tier (design doc §3, ADR-32): the task arrives as DIALOGUE, not as
the TC-7 goal — in T4 graphs `episode_goal` is not wired here at all
(validator rule DIALOGUE_GOAL_LEAK), so the policy never sees the
final corrected answer. On the human's `request`, the machine opens
the episode and emits `robot_msg` confirm naming the requested med,
then WAITS: `confirm_reply` releases the target_request; a pre-delivery
`correction` switches the active target and re-confirms once. Scripted
corrections count in `dialogue_corrections` — they are NOT HAR-3
retries (a correction is not a failure), so pass@1/pass@8 stay
comparable across tiers.
