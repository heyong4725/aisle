"""ik-trajectory node (CAP-5): grasp_pose + joint_state -> joint_cmd/gripper_cmd.

Staged pick-and-place executor: pregrasp along the grasp's approach axis,
descend, close, lift, transfer over the tray, lower, release, home.
Waypoints are solved with deterministic damped-least-squares IK on each
profile's shared kinematics: the verified Panda chain or the pinned official
SO-101 URDF chain. Commands stream at the joint_state cadence,
velocity-bounded per the manifest's max_joint_vel_rad_s. A reset aborts any
active plan (episode boundary — stale plans froze the guard in the first live
run).
