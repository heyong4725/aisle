"""grasp-planner-topdown node (CAP-5): target_pose -> grasp_pose.

Two approach modes, chosen by the shelf geometry (ADR-10):
- TOP level (no board above): classic top-down — fingers descend onto the
  box's top section, yaw across the narrower horizontal axis.
- LOWER levels: a board above makes any from-above descent collide (the
  hand column crosses the board; proven in the T08 live runs), so the
  grasp is a FRONT approach: wrist horizontal, the hand slides into the
  inter-board gap from the shelf front, fingers straddling the box sides.
The approach DISTANCE rides in grasp_pose metadata (approach_m) so
ik-trajectory can start its pregrasp clear of the shelf front. Med
dimensions come from meds.toml via the target_med metadata that
oracle-pose forwards.
