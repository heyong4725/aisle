"""In-process confinement of a monolithic orchestration module (SPEC 440,
MON-6/MON-7 — the broker-side half; the OS-level half is issue #353).

The agent module is executed by the broker inside a guarded window: its
imports go through `guarded_import`, which refuses the trusted AISLE assets
(verifier, reset, bridge, guard, driver, harness, registry), the dora
runtime, and every process/socket/network/FFI/introspection route the
MON-7 conformance list names. `open` is refused too, so the module has no
filesystem path of its own (the #353 profile closes the paths a module can
reach without Python). A refusal raises `ConfinementViolation`, which the
broker turns into an infrastructure-invalid record BEFORE any command or
score (MON-7: "denied or produce an infrastructure-invalid record").

`TrustedIntegrity` snapshots the code objects of the in-process trusted
callables (turn stamping, the pinned primitives) when the broker starts and
re-verifies them after every agent callback: a monkeypatch that swaps one
of them is caught before the next command leaves the broker.

This is not a sandbox: a module that reaches `builtins` through a literal
type walk can defeat an in-process hook. It is the fail-closed record layer
MON-7 asks for; the confinement policy of #353 is what makes bypass
impossible rather than recorded.
